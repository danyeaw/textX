// ^^^
// This is important for `test_lookup_multifile_missing_flag_m`:
// Here, we want to make sure the "#include" command is executed
//  - at the moment this happens only if any scope provide is active,
//    which is an ImportURI provder. In case eof RREL, a RREL
//    reference needs also to be present to trigger the load command
//    (see model.py, look for `ModelLoader`).
//  - once the model is loaded in the referenced test, we want to
//    make sure that the P1 reference from the included model is not
//    found (because of the missing +m flag).
